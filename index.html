				<h2>The Story of the Tesla stock</h2>
				<p id=artesla> In the beginning of 2019, tesla shares were trading around 300$ but investors were slowly starting to sell it off as they were not sure wether Tesla would be able to get out of debt and whether the company would be able to meet their expectations. The share price was down 130$ when it reached 170$ a share in June. Wall street investors started to talk about a possible bankruptcy of the company. However, the stock price started to rise again and in November, when tesla announced profit for their previous quarter, the stock value was up to 340$. As the price rose, new investors started coming in and the tesla shares started to grow exponentially. In January, they posted some positive results for their first quarter and the stock price sky rocketed above 950$. Now some investors are predicting 7000$ a share for the next five years and it seems like Tesla is on a good track to become world leader in the car industry.

				<h2>The rise of biotechnologies</h2>
				<p id=artesla> In december 2019, a new virus started to spead in CHina, the 2019Ncov. Some companies wanted to contain the virus and started to design some tests to know wether someone is sick or not. NOVACYT, a bitechnology company developed its own version of the test and they were the first to do so. When this new was announced, the share price started to rise dramatically, it went from 18 cts a share to 45cts a share in the first two days. As they obtained the European certification in the next days, the share price continued to rise and it closed at 1.218€ on Friday February 14. With the obtention of American certifications, some people value the share price at 3€. I think that NOVACYT is still a good investment and my optimal exit point is at 2€ a share for the next week. I also advise you to not buy shares above 1.4€ as it will be too risky of an investment</p>

				<h2>Uber's jump in the stock market</h2>
				<p id=artesla> Uber Went down by almost 50% in 2019 but some new investors started to see some potential in the company so the shares started going up from 25$ to 40$ since the end of November. After UBS initiated coverage of the stock with a buy rating and a price target of $56 per share, which reflects a 54% growth, Wall street started to see some potential in the stock as Uber negociated to be able to operate in Vancouver. I think that this stock is overbought and the technical indicator RSI confirms this fact so eventhough there is some hype around this stock in 2020, I don't think Wall street objectives are achivable</p>
